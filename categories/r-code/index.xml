      <description>I can spend a lot of time trying in futility to optimize custom functions and code.I’ll take the time to rewrite the same thing in two or more ways and run some basic benchmarks for performance differences.Most of the time I’m just exploring the simplest possible way to perform an action and what would be the most generalizable solution that could extend to other problems.I ran into an issue where I had to use a quick function to find the total amount of time a subject in a clinical trial was on a specific dose.</description>

      <description>Visual above made with Nathaniel Phillip’s VisualResume.
I am currently working as the Principal Data Analyst for Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, helping our Research &amp;amp; Development team monitor our current trials and prepare summary reports.I started learning R in my gradate statistics classes to avoid the future pains of having to use or only being familiar with SPSS.Learning R then launched me into a bigger role at Bracket (now Signant Health) where I had the pleasure to work with our Clinical Science team to understand and interpret their data.</description>
