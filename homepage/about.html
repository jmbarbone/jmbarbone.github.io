<p>I am currently working as the Principal Data Analyst for <a href="https://madrigalpharma.com/">Madrigal Pharmaceuticals</a>, helping our Research &amp; Development team monitor our current trials and prepare summary reports.
I started learning R in my gradate statistics classes to avoid the future pains of having to use or only being familiar with SPSS.
Learning R then launched me into a bigger role at Bracket (now <a href="https://signanthealth.com/">Signant Health</a>) where I had the pleasure to work with our Clinical Science team to understand and interpret their data.
This gave us the opportunity to learn more about our technologies, approaches, and quality of reporting in the clinical trials we were assisting.
Here I was a charter member of the Data Science team and have the pleasure of enhancing our trial monitoring products, training other Data Science programmers, and contributing to automation and reporting efforts of our Clinical Data Management team.</p>
<p>I have a Masters of Art in Psychology and have spent my graduate and undergrad classes engaging in Neuropsychology and Cognitive topics.
Some of these topics have included understanding how music affects our ability on tests of aptitude.
This, of course, was the basis of my Masters Thesis and plentify hours of reading journal article after journal article.
Of course I’ve also been very interested in immersing myself more into statistics, statistical programming, and special psychometric subjects.
Please browse the <a href="https://jmbarbone.github.io/homepage/anthology">Anthology page</a> where I have tried to compile projects, papers, and presentations I’ve written in and out of class.</p>
<p>And of course, here is my dog’s IG <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelabbuckley/">TheLabBuckley</a>. It’s mostly him sleeping.</p>
